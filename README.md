# MIPS-CPU

This project presents the design and implementation of a 5-stage MIPS processor using Verilog. The MIPS architecture is a widely used RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) architecture, known for its simplicity and efficiency. The processor design consists of five pipeline stages: Instruction Fetch (IF), Instruction Decode (ID), Execute (EX), Memory Access (MEM), and Write Back (WB), adhering to the classic MIPS pipeline structure.

Overall, this project demonstrates the successful implementation of a 5-stage MIPS processor using Verilog, showcasing the importance of data forwarding in pipelined architectures and stalling for certain instructions.
